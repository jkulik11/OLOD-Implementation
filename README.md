# OLOD-Implementation
Implementation of optimal linear orbit determination.

See the paper from Andrew Sinclair and Alan Lovell for more information on Optimal Linear Orbit Determination: https://doi.org/10.2514/1.G004182

We also employ the easy implementation of the Keplerian state transition matrix calculation technique from Direct Solution of the Keplerian State
Transition Matrix by Reid G. Reynolds: https://doi.org/10.2514/1.G006373
